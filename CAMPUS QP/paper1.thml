<p>1) A student scores 55% marks in 8 papers of 100 marks each. He scores 15% of his total marks in English. How much does he score in English?</p>


<p>a) 55</p><p>

b) 66</p><p>

c) 77</p><p>

d) 44</p><p>

e) None of these</p><p>


Answer: Option b</p><p>

Given that a student scores 55% marks in English in 8 papers of 100 marks each.</p><p>

Hence, his total marks = (55 x 800)/100 = 440</p><p>

15% of his 440 marks = 440*(15/100) = 66 = Marks scored in English.</p><p>


2) A software engineer creates a LAN game where an 8 digit code made up of 1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8 has to be decided on as a universal code. There is a condition that each number has to be used and no number can be repeated. What is the probability that the first 4 digits of the code are even number?
</p><p>

a) 1/70</p><p>

b) 1/840</p><p>

c) 1/8</p><p>

d) 1/40320</p><p>


Answer: Option a
</p><p>
Total no of possible ways are 8!</p><p>

The total number of possible ways to find even numbers at the last 4 digits are 4!</p><p>

The total number of possible ways to find odd numbers at the last 4 digits are 4!</p><p>

So, the probability that the first 4 digits of the code are even number =4!*4!/8! = 1/70</p><p>


3) A car is 250 meters behind the bus. The car and bus are moving at a speed of 60 km/hr and 35 km/hr respectively. In what time will the car be ahead of the bus by 250 meters.

</p><p>
a)37 secs</p><p>

b)48 secs</p><p>

c)72 secs</p><p>

d)68 secs</p><p>


Answer: Option c</p><p>

Relative speed = 60-35 = 25 Km/hr.</p><p>

For the car to be ahead of the bus by 250 meters, it needs to cover = 250+250 =500m = 0.5kms.</p><p>

Time taken to cover 0.5 km = 0.5/25 =1/50 hrs = 72 secs
</p><p>

4) Square of 2 more than a 2 digit number is multiplied and % by 2 and 5 respectively. If twice of the result is equal to 500 then find the number.
</p><p>

a) 45</p><p>

b) 23
</p><p>
c) 87</p><p>

d) 47</p><p>

Answer:Option b</p><p>

Let Y be the number</p><p>

(((Y+2)^2) x 2 % 5) 2 = 500.</p><p>

On solving this, you get Y = 23</p><p>


5) A, B and C can do a piece of work in 30, 45, and 90 days. In how many days can A alone do the work if he is assisted by B and C on every 4th day?
</p><p>

a) 12 days
</p><p>
b) 24 days</p><p>

c) 36 days
</p><p>
d) 48 days
</p><p>

Answer:Option b</p><p>

A's 1 day work = 1/30.</p><p>

A's 3 day work = 3/30</p><p>

(A+B+C) 1 day work = (1/30+1/45+1/90) = 1/15</p><p>

4 days work = 3/30+1/15 = 1/6.</p><p>

Total work will be done in= 4*6 = 24 days</p><p>


6) A starts a business with Rs.3500 and after 5 months, B joins with A as his partner. After a year, the profit is divided in the ratio 2:3. What is Bs contribution to the Capital?

b) 7500</p><p>

c) 9000</p><p>

d)9500
</p><p>

Answer:Option c</p><p>

Let x be the capital invested by B.
</p><p>
Profit will be divided in the ratio of 2:3 = (12*3500) : 7x = 6000 : x.
</p><p>
2/3 = 6000/x</p><p>

x = 9000</p><p>


7) What will be the value of x^(1/2).x^(1/4).x^(1/8)............to infinity.
</p><p>

a) x^2</p><p>

b) x</p><p>

c) x^(3/2)</p><p>

d) x^3</p><p>


Answer:Option c</p><p>

The term is x ^ (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...). Sum of infinite series with first term 1/2 and common ratio of 1/2 is 1. So the answer is 'x'.
</p><p>

8) For the word SURITI, if you arrange the letters in dictionary order then what is its rank?
</p><p>

a) 234
</p><p>
b) 235
</p><p>
c) 236
</p><p>
d) 237

</p><p>
Answer:Option c</p><p>

I = 5! =120</p><p>

R= 5!/2 =60</p><p>

SI = 4! =24</p><p>

SR = 4!/2 = 12</p><p>

ST = 4!/2 = 12</p><p>

SUI = 3! = 6</p><p>

= 234 Words
</p><p>

So, words with SUR begins from 235. SURIIT is the 235th word and SURITI is the 236rd word.
